# Brute-Force-Stable-Matching
Python program that gets number of all possible stable matches between two sets given preference lists.

Because this solution is brute force, it is very slow around when n > 8.

This was done for my algorithms class while we were learning about Gale Shapely.

This does not use Gale Shapely as that only returns 1 possible stable match.
